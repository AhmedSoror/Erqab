### Optimizing ride-hailing

As summer is approaching, people travel between Cairo and Sahel a lot possibly every weekend. Driving drains a lot of energy specially on hot days. I want to create a business to connect people together. Travelers are willing to pay up till certain amount of money and willing to take at least a certain amount of money in case they will be the ones to drive. The most challenging part about this business is deciding who should ride with who.
